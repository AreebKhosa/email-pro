üìù Step by step flow of the app

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sign up & login

User signs up, then must verify their email.

If email is not verified, they cannot log in.

Also option for Google login.

By default, all new users get the Demo plan.

‚ûï If user logs in from a new IP address, the system sends a verification code to their email. User must enter this code before they can continue.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Plan upgrade

User can upgrade their plan by paying through Stripe.

When payment is successful, their plan updates immediately.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Email integration

User can connect their SMTP + IMAP accounts.

The system must check if both connections are working.

User can only add integrations according to their plan limit.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Recipient lists

User can create lists of recipients.

They can add recipients one by one, or upload a CSV file.

The CSV file format must be told to user:

scss
Copy
Edit
name, last_name, company_name(optional), position(optional), email, website_link(optional)
User can see all their recipient lists, and see recipients inside each list.

All of this is restricted by their plan‚Äôs upload limit.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Deliverability check

User selects a list to check.

System checks emails to see how many are valid, risky or invalid.

Shows stats to the user.

Gives option to clean the list (remove bad emails).

This also counts towards their plan‚Äôs deliverability quota.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Personalize emails

User selects a list or a single recipient.

System scrapes the website link (if present) to get content.

Then uses AI (like ChatGPT or local LLM) to write a personalized email.

Before starting, system will ask user:

Type of email (marketing, outreach etc)

Tone (professional, friendly etc)

Max characters

What kind of call to actions

Then it creates personalized emails for all recipients in that list.

It updates the list with a new column personalized_email.

If website is missing, it leaves that blank.

Also user can download the updated list as Excel.

This stops when user‚Äôs monthly personalization limit is reached.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Warm-up

When user enables warm-up, their email is added to a private warm-up pool.

The system sends warm-up emails from their account to other users in the pool, and receives warm-up emails from them.

Also automatically replies to keep emails out of spam.

Shows stats:

How many sent daily

How many received

How many going to spam

How many recovered from spam

This is also limited by their plan‚Äôs warm-up quota.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Campaign creation

User creates a campaign by:

Giving it a name

Selecting a recipient list

Writing subject + body OR asking AI to generate it (same style as personalization)

Using placeholders like {name}, {company_name} in the email

Scheduling the campaign

Follow-ups:

Not allowed on Demo

Allowed 1 on Starter & Pro
 
Allowed 2 on Premium

Before sending, system checks:

If user has enough remaining email quota.

If campaign is too big for their limit, it will block and suggest to upgrade.

‚ûï System tracks campaign analytics like how many emails delivered, opened, clicked, bounced or marked as spam, and shows these stats to the user.

‚úÖ Done.
